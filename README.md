## About the Project

The Sorting Algorithm Visualizer is an educational tool that demonstrates the inner workings of various sorting algorithms. It uses **Pygame** to display bars of different lengths being sorted in real-time, accompanied by sound effects for each operation.

---

## Features

- Visualizes **20 sorting algorithms**, including:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Heap Sort
  - Pancake Sort
  - Stalin Sort
  - Bogo Sort
  - Sleep Sort
  - Slow Sort
  - Bozo Sort
  - Bogo Bogo Sort
  - Quantum Bogo Sort
  - Schrodinger Sort
  - Intelligent Design Sort
  - Miracle Sort
  - Radix Sort
  - Cocktail Shaker Sort
  - Bucket Sort
- Interactive controls to shuffle, resize, or reverse the list.
- Sound effects for each sorting step.
- **Epilepsy warning** for flashing visuals.
